// make the screen itself some sort of grid
//
// create an object type that'll have some sort of data to tell how to print itself
//
// have some sort of formatting function know how to print an object
//
// probably use a hashmap for storing the objects that exist
//
// have a way to 'spawn' and 'kill' objects
//
// don't bother with the physics this is just meant to be a screen that'll project
// in which can be moved
//
// after that's done make some sort of interactive system and build this code
// with that in mind
