# 2D Object Renderer

This is a program that displays a screen of text as pixels.
Pixels will contain object data and information as to what they should look like.

The screen will be able to render custom text based objects and do things such as.
- Create custom objects
- Do basic things to the objects like movements and rotation
- Check for interactions between objects
- Have the ability to write custom code for the objects

##### The Screen
Running a screen will involve creating your own separate function for it.

What your screen does depends entirely on what you want it to do and can do
with the tools available.

##### Objects
An object contains basic information such as it's.
- Name
- Size
- What the object looks like
- Position

There're built in things you can do to objects such as basic movement, rotation,
and collision detection.

If you need more than that it should be easy enough to write some custom functions
with the given tools.
